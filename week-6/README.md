# Week 6

## Lecture to-do
Implement the power method

## Homework
Implement the power method yourself. You can test your solver against [these test cases](https://github.com/rbxmath/Vector101/blob/c61122713ec862b7f6e24bfa3afd1a24a1ec0932/week-6/homework/EigenSolverTests.lua#L4-L62), which I generated using Mathematica.
