# Week 7

## Lecture to-do
Implement matrix inversion via row reduction

## Homework
1. Add the following methods to your Matrix class:
* `Matrix:Invert()`: Computes the inverse of the matrix via row reduction
* `Matrix:Determinant()`: Computes the determinant of the matrix via cofactor expansion
2. *(Optional)* Prove that a function is invertible if and only if it is bijective.
