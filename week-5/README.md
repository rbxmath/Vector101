# Week 5

New this week: All code from previous weeks will be carried over into later weeks. This is to emphasize that we are building our own linear algebra library.

## Lecture to-do
* Implement row reduction.

## Homework
* Write your own row reduce function using partial pivoting that brings a matrix to RREF. [(solution)](https://github.com/rbxmath/Vector101/blob/cf97625868db499e90430600cc1409a789a276b4/week-5/homework/SystemSolver.lua#L8-L91)
* Write a function that determines how many solutions a matrix in RREF has. [(solution)](https://github.com/rbxmath/Vector101/blob/cf97625868db499e90430600cc1409a789a276b4/week-5/homework/SystemSolver.lua#L93-L123)
* Using the procedure described in lecture 9, compute which vectors span the nullspace of a matrix. [(solution)](https://github.com/rbxmath/Vector101/blob/cf97625868db499e90430600cc1409a789a276b4/week-5/homework/SystemSolver.lua#L125-L163)
