# Week 5

New this week: All code from previous weeks will be carried over into later weeks. This is to emphasize that we are building our own linear algebra library.

## Lecture to-do
* Implement row reduction.

## Homework
* Write your own row reduce function using partial pivoting that brings a matrix to RREF.
* Write a function that determines how many solutions a matrix in RREF has.
* Using the procedure described in lecture 9, compute which vectors span the nullspace of a matrix.
