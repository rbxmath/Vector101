# Vector101
Code presented for the [Vector101](https://rbxmath.org/vector101) course.

Each week has two folders: The `lecture` folder contains code presented during lecture, along with any supplemental material. The `homework` folder contains the same code but with the homework exercises completed.

Lecture code will be uploaded before lecture. Completed homework exercises will be uploaded a week after the lecture in which they were assigned.
