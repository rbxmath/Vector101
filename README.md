# Vector101
Code presented for the [Vector101](https://rbxmath.org/vector101) course.

Each week has two folders: The `lecture` folder contains code presented during lecture, along with any supplemental material. The `homework` folder contains the same code but with the homework exercises completed. All of the luau files in each folder are also contained in a Roblox place file.

Lecture code will be uploaded before lecture. Homework solutions will be uploaded a week after the lecture from which they were assigned.
